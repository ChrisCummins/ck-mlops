## Overview

*There are numerous CK components spread across numerous GitHub repositories. 
Based on the feedback from the community, we have created this repository 
to collect all the main CK components related to AI and ML Systems in one place. 
These components are also uploaded to the [cKnowledge.io platform](https://cKnowledge.io) 
similar to PyPI to help you search for specific components and see their connections!*

This repository contains a collection of **stable** CK components (automation recipes and workflows)
for AI and ML systems in the [CK format](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01149.pdf):

* CK modules with automation actions: [[list](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/tree/master/ck/repo/module)]
* CK program workflows: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/programs )]
* CK meta packages: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/packages )]
* CK software detection: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/soft )]
* CK datasets: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/c/dataset )]
* CK adaptive containers: [[list]( https://cKnowledge.io/c/docker )]

## Current projects
* Developing a platform to automate SW/HW co-design for ML Systems across diverse models, data sets, frameworks and platforms based on user constraints in terms of speed, accuracy, energy and costs: [OctoML.ai](https://OctoML.ai) & [cKnowledge.io](https://cKnowledge.io)
* [Automating MLPerf(tm) inference benchmark and packing ML models, data sets and frameworks as CK components with a unified API and meta description](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-automation/README.md)
* Providing a common format to share artifacts at ML, systems and other conferences: [video](https://youtu.be/DIkZxraTmGM), [Artifact Evaluation](https://cTuning.org/ae)
* Redesigning CK together with the community based on user feedback
* [Other real-world use cases](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) from MLPerf&trade;, Qualcomm, Arm, General Motors, IBM, the Raspberry Pi foundation, ACM and other great partners;
